# A Scalable Real-Time Data Assimilation Framework for Predicting Turbulent Atmosphere Dynamics
This repository contains the scalable implementation of our generic real-time data assimilation (DA) framwork for estimating turbulent dynamics, consisting of ensemble score filter (EnSF), vision Transformer (ViT) surrogate, and coupled experiments.    


## Contributions
- A generic real-time data assimilation (DA) framework for estimating turbulent dynamics, providing significantly more accurate predictions than the state-of-the-art LETKF method.
- Strong and weak scaling capabilities of our proposed DA framework on the Frontier supercomputer.
- Large-scale ViT training up to 2.5B parameters on Frontier.
